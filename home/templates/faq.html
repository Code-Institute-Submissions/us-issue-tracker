    <!-- Questions -->
    <ul class="faqs">
        <li><strong>Is this service free?</strong></li>
        <li>It is free to report a bug and request a feature, however, upvoting a feature is not free and requires a payment of Â£20 to do so. 
        Upvoting a bug and commenting on both bugs and features is free.</li>
        <li><strong>Why do I have to pay to upvote a feature?</strong></li>
        <li>Developing a new feature requires the developers to be paid for their time and effort put into making it. The more funds available for a certain feature, the higher priority it is for it to be developed.</li>
        <li><strong>Why does Unicorn Simulator have so many bugs?</strong></li>
        <li>Unicorn Simulator was launched in February 2019 - with the application being so new to the market, it is understandable to see a large amount of bugs being reported, and these will be promptly fixed for free by our dedicated team of developers.</li>
        <li><strong>How much time is spent on developing new features?</strong></li>
        <li>We promise to dedicate at least 50% of our time on developing the highest-paid feature. The more upvotes a new feature has, the quicker it is developed. The other 50% of our time is spent on fixing bugs.</li>
        <li><strong>How can I keep updated on the development progress for bugs and features?</strong></li>
        <li>You can keep up to date with our progress by signing up to our weekly newsletter - these will be received via email.</li>
